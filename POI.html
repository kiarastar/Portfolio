<h2>Pahlevan of Iran</h2>
<p>Surprising even for Iranian journalists and locals, and unlike what it first appears, the Iranian “Pahlevan” MMA Championship League is broadcast live on YouTube for promotion. The surprise dissipates gradually with every step an onlooker takes into the fighting hall, if they are granted entry, which is for the most part reserved to a limited number of carefully chosen spectators. Part of the surprise is the events are held in a wedding hall or venues allocated to other sports like handball and volleyball. This particular discipline is neither supported nor banned by the state, and thus deprived of official financial aid or organizational provisions, surviving solely on private knowhow and management.​ </p>
