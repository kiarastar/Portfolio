<h2>Dammed and Erased</h2>
<p>Hasankeyf is one of the oldest human settlements in the world, located on the banks of the Tigris River in Turkey. It has been continuously inhabited for the past 12,000 years yet this cultural treasure is about to be erased forever.
​Now the imminent completion of the nearby Ilisu Dam, begun in 2006, is threatening to inundate all of Hasankeyf’s historical treasures and nearby villages under a 135 km long reservoir while displacing some 100,000 people. The Turkish government has built a soulless new town called New Hasankeyf nearby, providing housing for the displaced. Some of the most prominent historical remnants have been hauled from the river valley into the new town and plonked among the rows of identical new-builds on top of a hill on the opposite bank. The local mayor has given the remaining residents until 8 October to evacuate the old town. </p>
